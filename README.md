## About The Project

<p>You will develop the backend of an e-commerce application to be able to sell products in an area of your choice. The server will be based on a layered design, oriented to MVC and its code will contain the most solid programming structures from the ECMAScript language.</p>
<p><strong>The following criteria will be taken into account:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maintain correct session management</strong><br />Consistency of session policies is maintained. Maintaining what a particular user or administrator can and cannot do, based on their role.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing process</strong><br />You can add the desired products (keeping in mind that a premium user cannot buy your products or an admin cannot buy).<br />The cart is correctly managed when adding or removing products from it.<br />A complete purchase closing is carried out with information.</p>
<p><strong>Project architecture</strong><br />At the end of the project, its architecture must be maintained in layers, keeping responsibilities well delegated.<br />Avoid keeping project elements isolated (that is, without belonging to any particular layer).<br />Well-justified creation of layers as needed (such as a layer of middlewares in case they are being left scattered in the project).</p>
